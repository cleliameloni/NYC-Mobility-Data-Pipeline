# NYC-Mobility-Data-Pipeline
A Data Management architecture designed to govern the full lifecycle of NYC urban mobility data. The system integrates heterogeneous sources—transactional CSVs, meteorological REST APIs, and web-scraped sports schedules—to create a reconciled, high-quality Analytical Base Table (ABT) stored in a relational database.
